# osu-status

Even though osu-status is, I believe, a useful tool for osu players, I will not be pursuing it further. The current implementation is a poor design that I created as a student - perhaps my first real personal project that did something useful. The project is now archived - if it makes a return it would be as a web application with peppy's blessing.
